# Google Apps API

## What is this?

This is another GoogleApps API Library.  I know there is one floating around out there but it is 2 years old and doesn't claim to do more than: users, groups, and calendar.

The goal here is a library that supports the entire GoogleApps Domain and Applications APIs.

  * Public Key Upload
  * Email Audit

  * Email Migration
